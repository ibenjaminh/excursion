# Excursion
# Simple Website Project

Welcome! This repository is home to a basic website I put together. The main goal wasn't just to create a site but to get familiar with using Git in the terminal and setting up GitHub authentication with a personal token.

## Learning Focus

- **Git Commands**: Explored basic Git commands for version control.
- **Terminal Use**: Practiced using the terminal for Git operations.
- **GitHub Authentication**: Learned how to create and use a personal access token for GitHub.

Thank you, 
Izaac
